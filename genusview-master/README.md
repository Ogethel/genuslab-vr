![screenshot](images/screenshot-small.png)

A utility for drawing on a genus two surface and its universal cover, which updates both pictures in real time.  This is meant to be used to understand the universal covering of a hyperbolic surface.  Developed in [Unity 3D](http://unity3d.com/unity).

## Status

Alpha quality; see [the list of known issues](KNOWN_ISSUES.md).

This program was developed as a prototype for a Fall 2018 project in the [Mathematical Computing Laboratory](http://mcl.math.uic.edu/) at UIC in which undergraduate students will seek to develop a VR port, and to refine the program and add additional features.
